## About the Project

**Egg Hunter YYC** is a fun, interactive way for users to connect with our
physical city and learn more about our own culture, history and future. The
app also paves the way for the city’s different cultural organizations, as well
as artists, changemakers and truth-tellers from diverse backgrounds, to
share their work, amplifying their voice and impact in our city.

Egg Hunter YYC is a mobile application which utilizes
a user’s location to orient them towards zones, filled
with virtual “eggs” to discover and unlock. These
caches of information can include audio, visual or even augmented-reality content from local content-
creators. A supporting [**website**](www.egghunter.ca) was created to support users learning more about the
application.
